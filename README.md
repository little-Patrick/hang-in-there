# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This app helps you keep a level head. It will give you motivational posters to help lift your spirits, but if those spirits get too high and need to be knocked down a peg. We have just the thing for that, the Unmotivation Poster sectionr! It little chunk of motivation, so you are never too happy. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
The steps are as followed:
1. Go to https://github.com/little-Patrick/hang-in-there and either clone or fork the repository then clone it.
2. Once the repo is cloned cd into the directory hang-in-there
3. run open index.html to open the program in your default web browser and enjoy the level headedness.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)
It took a some playing around with the flexbot to get the images to squish down like the frame was.![Picture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/680fc84f-7c20-4ff6-b851-6f5e6d668530)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am in the second week of mod 2, I tried to work on an iteration a day since we were given 9 days to work on it. It gave me some wiggle room since there were less iterations than days fto complete the project. 

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
During this project getting into a good workflow was the toughest thing at first and so I tried to focus on that. It was different than ruby since you were using just console.logs and the browser to debug code. It was a little different switching to another application to debugg and run the code. I also liked playing around in the dev tools, but forgot that they didn't save when you refreshed, so I had to do a few things twice and reverse-engineer things a few times.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One things was the length of the JS file. For a lot of the project I had the JS file opened twice so I could see the top of the file where all the variables were and remind myself what variable were which and what they did. Also, I am not the biggest fan of the new docs I need to spend more time looking through them because most of the time I have to google the function I think I want and slap mdn on the end of it to get to the correct page for the function. 
The biggest win I had was figuring out for loops, I have seen them in other languages but they always intimidated me, now that I know what each peice of inside the () is doing I am much more confident with them and find them fun for the lack of abstraction they provide.
